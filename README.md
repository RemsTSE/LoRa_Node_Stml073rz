# LoRa-mesh Network Routing and Scheduling

This project is an implementation of routing and scheduling for a LoRa network, using a binary search tree (BST) based routing table and a distributed scheduling algorithm. The project is currently under development.

## Overview

LoRa (Long Range) is a low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) technology designed for long-distance communication at low data rates. It's perfect for Internet of Things (IoT) applications where devices need to send small amounts of data over long distances for many years on a small battery.

The key components of this project are:

- **Routing Table**: The routing table of each node is implemented as a binary search tree for efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations. The routing table keeps track of a node's neighbors and second-hop neighbors, along with the associated spreading factors.

- **Distributed Scheduling Algorithm**: A distributed scheduling algorithm is used to assign transmission slots to each node, taking into account the spreading factor of each link. The algorithm is designed to handle cases where a neighbor node is unavailable or unresponsive.

## Project Status

This project is currently in progress. So far, we have implemented the basic structure of the routing table and defined key operations on it. We are now in the process of implementing the distributed scheduling algorithm.
